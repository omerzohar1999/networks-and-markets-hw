# DO NOT SUBMIT THIS FILE
# It is just an example of a few tests that we will run on your code that you can use as a starting point
# to make sure the code is correct.
# You should put tester.py in the same folder as hw2_p9.py and hw2_p10.py, 
# as well as "facebook_combined.txt", and run this file.
# This is a sanity check and not representative of the final tests we will run on your submission.

# IMPORTANT
# We recommend that you write your own tests, in order to verify the correctness of your own code.
# This file is just a sanity check, and will not catch most bugs.
